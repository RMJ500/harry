        <h3 style="text-align: center;">chapter 1</h3>
        <P>The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow,
            moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other's
            chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their
            cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.
             "News?" asked the taller of the two.
             "The best," replied Severus Snape.
            The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by
            a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their
            ankles as they marched.
             "Thought I might be late," said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of
            sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. "It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that
            your reception will be good?"
             Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway
            that led off the lane. The high hedge curved into them, running off into the
            distance beyond the pair of imposing wrought-iron gates barring the men’s way.
            Neither of them broke step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of
            salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal was smoke.
            The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men’s footsteps. There was a
            rustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his
            companion’s head, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a
            pure-white peacock, strutting majestically along the top of the hedge.
            “He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks …” Yaxley thrust his wand
            back under his cloak with a snort.
            A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the
            straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows.
            Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel
            crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the front door,
            which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it.
            The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a
            magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced
            portraits on the wall followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men
            halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room, hesitated for the
            space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle.
            The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate
            table. The room’s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls.
            Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece
            surmounted by a gilded mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the
            threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn
            upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently unconscious human
            figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended by
            an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of
            the table below. None of the people seated underneath this singular sight were
            looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it. He
            seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so.
            “Yaxley. Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. “You are very
            nearly late.”</P>
